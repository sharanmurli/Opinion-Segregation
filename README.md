# Opinion Segregation Using Pig and MapReduce

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Opinion Segregation Using Pig and MapReduce," developed as a mini project for the Big Data Analytics course in the Computer Engineering Department at SIES Graduate School of Technology, affiliated with the University of Mumbai.

## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to analyze and segregate the opinions of people on a specific event using the Hadoop ecosystem services like Pig and MapReduce. The project focuses on categorizing the opinions from Twitter data related to the demonetization decision by the Government of India into positive and negative sentiments.

## Objectives

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classify the sentiments of people based on their opinions on microblogging platforms like Twitter.
- **MapReduce Implementation**: Understand and implement the MapReduce methodology using Apache Pig.
- **Public Opinion Analysis**: Analyze public opinions on a particular event and provide statistical analysis for decision making.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Provide faster processing of large datasets using Hadoop and Pig.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the Hadoop ecosystem and the objectives of the project.
2. **Literature Survey**: Review of existing techniques and methodologies for sentiment analysis and opinion segregation.
3. **Project Implementation**: Detailed steps for setting up the Hadoop and Pig environment, and executing the MapReduce jobs.
4. **Project Inputs and Outputs**: Description of the datasets used, input details, evaluation parameters, and output screenshots.
5. **Summary and Future Scope**: Summary of the project and potential areas for future work.

## Implementation Details

### Methodology

1. **Setup**: Configure Hadoop and Pig in the Ubuntu system.
2. **Data Loading**: Load the tweets dataset and dictionary file into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
3. **Pig Script Execution**: Run the Pig Latin script to perform opinion segregation using the MapReduce framework.

### Results

The Pig script processes the tweets and segregates them into positive and negative sentiments. The results are stored in HDFS and can be viewed using Hadoop commands.

## Future Scope

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Extend the project to process real-time data streams using Spark and Kafka.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Develop interactive visualizations for better insights using tools like Apache Zeppelin.
- **Broader Analysis**: Expand the analysis to include multiple events and more extensive datasets.
